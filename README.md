## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General informations
Version: 15. Bonus included. Subject attached. </br>
I did my best to create a codebase that is as clean and efficient as possible, while also maximizing the reuse of basic functions in more complex ones. </br>
In addition, I included some personal notes that delve into specific aspects of my implementation, including an argument for why `atoi` should not handle overflow, as well as detailed theoretical explanations. </br>
Most of the explanations were generated by GPT-4, with edits by me. </br>
