	Libft
</h1>

## 🧰 General information
Version: 15. Bonus included.</br>
I did my best to create a codebase that is as clean and efficient as possible, while also maximizing the reuse of basic functions in more complex ones.</br>

## ⚙️ Implementation details
In `libft_docs.md` some personal notes that delve into specific aspects of my implementation and detailed theoretical explanations. Special mention for an argument about why `atoi` should not handle overflow.</br>
Most of the explanations were generated by GPT-4, with edits by me.</br>

## 🚀 Extended version
This repo is an extended version my libft.</br>
The original project is stored in the .tar archive.

Change log:
- Makefile create obj/ directory.
- Function classified in directories.
- Header in a new include/ directory.
- Implementation of `ft_strcmp`.
- Implementation of `ft_write_fd` (as `ft_putstr_fd`, but return the write syscall return).
- Modification of `ft_lstclear` and `ft_lstdelone` to accept a `NULL` pointer as delete function. Useful to delete the structure list without it's content. Use with caution, if the content of the list has not been kept somewhere, it may lead to leaks!
