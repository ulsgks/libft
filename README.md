	Libft
</h1>

## 🧰 General information
Version: 15. Bonus included.</br>
I did my best to create a codebase that is as clean and efficient as possible, while also maximizing the reuse of basic functions in more complex ones.</br>

## ⚙️ About the implementation
In `libft_docs.md` some personal notes that delve into specific aspects of my implementation and detailed theoretical explanations. Special mention for an argument about why `atoi` should not handle overflow.</br>
Most of the explanations were generated by GPT-4, with edits by me.</br>

## 🚀 Extended version

The original project is stored in the .tar archive.
